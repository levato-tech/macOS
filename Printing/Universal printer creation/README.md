# Universal printer creation
A universal way to add printers scripted and works from Mac OS X 10.6 until the most recent version of macOS.

This script can be run in different ways: 
* You can run this script only once.
* It can be run each time when a user logs in (in combination with a login script), when the machine boots or at logout (not recommended).

**Remark:** The color mode and duplex values can be different depending on your printer driver. Make sure to verify this manually.
